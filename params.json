{"name":"Shalini Pandey","tagline":"Amazon Development Centre, India","body":"### About me\r\nI obtained my B.Tech. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the **Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi** and am currently working as a software developer with Amazon Development Centre, India since July'15. My research interests include but are not limited to Machine Learning, Data Mining and Information Retrieval. \r\n\r\n[Curriculum Vitae](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzySebQFnADxeS1hY0pnSjF2bnc/view)\r\n\r\n### Looking back...\r\n* **Jan-May'15** : As a Teaching Assistant at the Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi, I taught Computer Programming specifically 'C' to 1st year UG students.\r\n\r\n* **May-July'14** : Intern at Amazon Development Centre, India. \r\n* **May-July'13** : Application Developer Intern at Information Technology Services, Tata Steel.\r\n\r\n### Achievements\r\n* Secured 11th Rank in Codeforces contest and 93rd rank in google APAC in 2015.\r\n \r\n* Participated in ACM ICPC Amritapuri regions twice in 2013 and 2014. \r\n\r\n* Conferred with the Super Achiever's award for academic excellence in 12th Standard.\r\n\r\n* Secured All-India-Rank 2293 in IIT-JEE, 2011 (99.8 percentile)\r\n\r\n* Secured All-India-Rank 1394 in AIEEE, 2011 (99.96 percentile)\r\n\r\n* Gold Medal in National Science Olympiad in 2008. \r\n\r\n### Projects Undertaken\r\n* As a part of my undergraduate B.Tech. project I worked with Prof. K.K. Shukla, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT BHU on Link Prediction Algorithms which involved predicting association/friendship in social networking sites. We compared various algorithms on the basis of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity. Taking a step ahead we passed the results obtained by weak learners as parameters to an Artificial Neural Network wherein the weights were learnt by back propagation method which improved the sensitivity and the accuracy was comparable.\r\n\r\n* My summer internship at Amazon Development Centre, India involved the development of a web portal for Routing rules based on their different properties such as dimension and value. The project gave me a hands-on experience in various languages like Java, XML, JavaScript and frameworks and techniques like Spring MVC and Dependency Injection. The design of mock-ups to final launch and working on both front-end and middle tier was indeed a fruitful experience.\r\n\r\n* The project on Online Auction for Used Assets in Information Technology Services, Tata Steel exposed me to MSSQL. The development work was done using Visual Basics as Backend and CSS as frontend.\r\n\r\n* To quench my inherent interest in Algorithms, I undertook couple of semester projects as well. I solved the Vehicle Routing Problem using Clarks and Wrights Savings algorithm, Sweep Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm. I also implemented the B-tree and the famous mathematical and logic puzzle Kakuro and Spellathon on Java. \r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nSahil Gupta, Shalini Pandey and K.K.Shukla, \"Comparison Analysis of Link Prediction Algorithms in Social Network\", _International Journal of Computer Applications_  Volume 111-No. 16, February 2015.
